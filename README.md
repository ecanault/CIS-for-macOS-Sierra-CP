Refers to document CIS_Apple_OSX_10.12_Benchmark_v1.0.0.pdf, available at https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org

USAGE:

Create a single Jamf Policy using all three scripts.
1_Set_Organization_Priorities - Script Priority: Before
2_Security_Audit_Compliance - Script Priority: Before
3_Security_Remediation - Script Priority: Before
2_Security_Audit_Compliance - Script Priority: After

# 1_Set_Organization_Priorities

Policy: Some recurring trigger to track compliance over time.

Admins set organizational compliance for each listed item, which gets written to plist. The values default to "true," meaning if an organization wishes to disregard a given item they must set the value to false by changing the associated comment:

OrgScore1_1="true" or OrgScore1_1="false"

The script writes to /Library/Application Support/SecurityScoring/org_security_score.plist by default.

NOTES: 

Item "1.1 Verify all Apple provided software is current" is disabled by default.
Item "2.1.2 Turn off Bluetooth "Discoverable" mode when not pairing devices - not applicable to 10.9 and higher."
	Starting with OS X (10.9) Bluetooth is only set to Discoverable when the Bluetooth System Preference is selected. 
	To ensure that the computer is not Discoverable do not leave that preference open.
Item "2.3.3 Verify Display Sleep is set to a value larger than the Screen Saver (Not Scored)"
	The rationale in the CIS Benchmark for this is incorrect. The computer will lock if the 
	display sleeps before the Screen Saver activates
Item "2.6.6 Enable Location Services (Not Scored)" is disabled by default.
	As of macOS 10.12.6, Location Services cannot be enabled/monitored programmatically.
	It is considered user opt in.
Item "2.6.7 Monitor Location Services Access (Not Scored)" is disabled by default.
	As of macOS 10.12.6, Location Services cannot be enabled/monitored programmatically.
	It is considered user opt in.
Item "2.8.1 Time Machine Auto-Backup " is disabled by default.
	Time Machine is typically not used as an Enterprise backup solution
Item "2.8.2 Time Machine Volumes Are Encrypted (Not Scored)" is disabled by default.
	Time Machine is typically not used as an Enterprise backup solution
Item "2.12 Securely delete files as needed (Not Scored)" is disabled by default.
	With the wider use of FileVault and other encryption methods and the growing use of Solid State Drives
	the requirements have changed and the "Secure Empty Trash" capability has been removed from the GUI.
Item "3.4 Enable remote logging for Desktops on trusted networks (Not Scored)" is disabled by default.
	The built-in syslog capability in OS X runs over UDP without encryption. Broadcasting log unencrypted over 
	the internet is not a good idea. While syslog may be acceptable on some internal trusted networks it is not a 
	solution for mobile devices that hop between networks.
Item "4.3 Create network specific locations (Not Scored)" is disabled by default.
Item "5.4 Automatically lock the login keychain for inactivity" is disabled by default.
Item "5.5 Ensure login keychain is locked when the computer sleeps" is disabled by default.
Item "5.6 Enable OCSP and CRL certificate checking" is disabled by default.
Item "5.14 Do not enter a password-related hint (Not Scored)" is disabled by default.
	Not needed if 6.1.2 Disable "Show password hints" is enforced.
Item "5.16 Secure individual keychains and items (Not Scored)" is disabled by default.
Item "5.17 Create specialized keychains for different purposes (Not Scored)" is disabled by default.
Item "5.19 Install an approved tokend for smartcard authentication" is disabled by default.
	This is superseded by the macos 10.12.x built in SmartCardServices and CryptoTokenKit. 
Item "6.4 Safari disable Internet Plugins for global use (Not Scored)" is disabled by default.
Item "6.5 Use parental controls for systems that are not centrally managed (Not Scored)" is disabled by default.

# 2_Security_Audit_Compliance

Policy: Some recurring trigger to track compliance over time. Run this before and after 3_Security_Remediation to audit the Remediation

Reads the plist at /Library/Application Support/SecurityScoring/org_security_score.plist. For items prioritized (listed as "true,") the script queries against the current computer/user environment to determine compliance against each item.

Non-compliant items are recorded at /Library/Application Support/SecurityScoring/org_audit

# 2.5_Audit_List Extension Attribute

Set as Data Type "String."

Reads contents of /Library/Application Support/SecurityScoring/org_audit file and records to Jamf Pro inventory record.

# 2.6_Audit_Count Extension Attribute

Set as Data Type "Integer." 

Reads contents of /Library/Application Support/SecurityScoring/org_audit file and records count of items to Jamf Pro inventory record. Usable with smart group logic (2.6_Audit_Count greater than 0) to immediately determine computers not in compliance.
